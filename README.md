# Simple Rock-Paper-Scissor simulator against PC

The operation of this simulator is very simple as it does not use any type of artificial intelligence but simply uses the mechanism of random choice between the three possibilities (Rock, Paper, Scissor). Initially the user and computer scores are set to 0 and the victory is attributed to the first who reaches 3 points. Subsequently the user is asked to choose between Rock, Paper or Scissor and through random.choice() the choice of the computer is made. For each "game" it is printed who wins or if there was a tie.
