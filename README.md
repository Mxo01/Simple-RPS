# Simple Rock-Paper-Scissor simulator against PC

## Introduction
The operation of this simulator is very simple as it does not use any type of 
artificial intelligence but simply uses the mechanism of random choice between 
the three possibilities (Rock, Paper, Scissor). Initially the user and computer 
scores are set to 0 and the victory is attributed to the first who reaches 3 points.
Subsequently the user is asked to choose between Rock, Paper or Scissor and through 
random.choice() the choice of the computer is made. For each "game" it is printed 
who wins or if there was a tie.
